              Sorry I never really get used to being flung around the internet. It's a rather jarring experience,
              wouldn'tcha say?.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anywho! Welcome! This is Satanic Plaza! I am your web witch Llama.
            </p>
            <p>
              I built this little cabin in the woods of the internet as a personal refugeâ€”to learn, explore, and share
              my studies. I
              was a professional musician in Los Angeles, but after many many years of selling myself I grew tired and
              decided to
              breakup with capitalism. </p>
            <img src='assets/images/itsnotme.gif' alt='blinkies.cafe | make your own blinkies!'></a>
            <p>
              I do not know exactly what's next, but I'm eager to learn. My current interests are in tech recycling,
              linux, self-hosting, coding, magic the gathering, farming, herbalism... ok
              so really anything. I am deeply passionate about communism, ethical living and mutual aid. I hope that my
              studies can be
              used to reduce my carbon footprint and contribute to community.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started learning linux and coding fairly recently and have enjoyed the process thoroughly. Within the
              plaza you will find
              blog posts about my current projects, studies, and community efforts. A good hallmark of any witch is a
              bit of clutter and
              disorganization, so the plaza is sure to be a mess. I hope you enjoy turning over stones and perusing junk
              drawers.
            </p>

              If you have great links, projects ideas, or just want to say howdy, feel free to write in the guest book.

              Light as a feather, Never get bored!

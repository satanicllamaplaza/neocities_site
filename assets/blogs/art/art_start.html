<h2>Not an Artist</h2>

  I am no artist, not anymore, but I do make art!
</p>
<p>
  This simple gallery will be a random smattering of pictures and drawings. I Used to be obsessed with lomography 
  and even tried my hand at it for a while but it is a painfully expensive hobby. So I bought a programmable camera 
  that really embodies the spirit of lomography. It has terrible quality, its highly unpredictable and I never know 
  what I have till I get home.

  With this camera I hope to program some of my own filters like a double exposure or an imbalance of color. I will 
  talk about any filters I make in the 
  <a href="./code.html" style="color: #70807d;">Conjoring Code</a>
   section of this website.

<p>
  I may post a doodle or a song in here who knows. The world is my oyster... I just fucking hate oysters!

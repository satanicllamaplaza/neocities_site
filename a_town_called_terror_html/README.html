<h1 id="a-town-called-terror-card-game">A Town Called Terror Card
Game</h1>
<p>A Magic The Gathering style card game that is accesible to first time
players.</p>
<p>In a sleepy town called Terror several witches compete to be crowned
The Queen of the Danmed. Build your alter and summon the retched. If you
can defend yourself and kill your oponents, then you will rign over the
town of Terror.</p>
<p>A Town Called Terror aims to keep as much of the Magic The Gathering
functionality and play style as possible, while relieving some of the
more complicated aspects. It will have a large collection of cards (600
in total) that are all unique. Instead of drafting or deck building
players will all draw from the same stack of cards. This will help game
play begin immidiatly and reduce the knowlege and skill required to have
fun. This could be a great introductory game for new magic players or a
nice change of pace for veterans.</p>

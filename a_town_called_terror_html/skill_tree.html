<h1 id="skill-tree-concept">Skill Tree Concept</h1>
<p><strong>The skill tree idea may or may not make it into the
game.</strong></p>
<p>Skills: * Clairvoyance (skry) * Potion Making (food)</p>
<p>Each skill starts at 10 for each player. This means it costs 10 alter
cards to perform a skill. Each permenant (creature, item, ect) will have
skill markers on it. Those skill markers reduce the skill costs for as
long as they are on the field.</p>
<p>For example a Hag card could have 1 potion marker and 1 clairvoyance
marker. This would make the players alter costs 9 for each of those
skills. When that Hag is killed the alter costs for those skills would
go back up by 1.</p>
<p>No skill can ever cost less than 1 alter card to perform.</p>
